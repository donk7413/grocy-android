[I have another question.](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android/blob/master/FAQ.md#user-content-support)

<br />

<a name="faq1"></a>
**(1) Which permissions are needed and why?**

The following Android permissions are needed:

* *have full network access* (INTERNET): to access your grocy server
* *view network connections* (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE): to monitor internet connectivity changes
* *have camera access* (CAMERA): to scan barcodes
* *have access to vibration* (VIBRATE): to vibrate after a barcode was detected

<br />

<a name="faq2"></a>
**(2) How do I know what something does?**

Starting with Android 8 you can long press almost every clickable element without a label to see what it will do.

<br />

<a name="faq3"></a>
**(3) My API key is invalid. What can I do?**

Tap CREATE KEY to open the key management page of your Grocy instance.
Create a new key and copy it to your clipboard, then paste it in the key field of Grocy Android and try again.

If you use Hass.io with the Grocy Add-on, read [this](https://github.com/patzly/grocy-android/blob/master/FAQ.md#user-content-faq4) section.

<br />

<a name="faq4"></a>
**(4) How can I use this app with Hass.io?**

In the Supervisor of Hass.io, open the Configuration tab of the Grocy Add-on.
Change the host port (which will be exposed) from "null" to any other number like "40" (without the quotes) in the Network section.
Now in this app here in the field "Server URL", enter the domain or IP address of your Hass.io server together with ":" and the chosen port number.
So the Server URL can look like this:

- `http://192.168.178.123:40`
- `https://myhassioserver.com:40`

Attention! If your Hass.io server is publicly accessible, following points are important for you:

- Make sure that you have set up a working HTTPS certificate in the Configuration section of the Grocy Add-on.
- Start the URL with "https://" like above.
- Set a strong password for all users in Grocy (default is "admin"), because anyone has now access to your Grocy instance and it is not protected by Hass.io login anymore.

**(5) Why are my barcodes unreadable if I use the selfie camera?**

Most devices have a front camera with a fixed focus for the normal distance between your face and the device.
With this distance, the picture resolution is sometimes too low for the scanning algorithm.

<br />

<a name="faq6"></a>
**(6) What is the APK with ML Kit as barcode scanner?**

(Coming soon)

It is possible to use the APK option with ML Kit as barcode recognition instead of ZXing.
ML Kit uses (like the names indicates) a machine learning approach for barcode recognition and works with a trained model instead of stroke width detection.
This has many advantages:

- No horizontal alignment of barcodes necessary
- We never saw any recognition mistakes
- It uses the new CameraX implementation

<br />

**(7) How can I connect to my instance through Tor Hidden Service?**

This is only available on v1.9.0 and later.  
Simply enter your onion hostname in the server field like this:

`http://myhiddenservice.onion`

Orbot needs to be installed on you device and will be automatically launched if it's not running.
Currently there can be error messages if Orbot is not connected after you press the login button.
